# fizzbuzz kata

I've taken the problem from [Coding Dojo's KataFizzBuzz](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataFizzBuzz)

I've solved the kata in branch master (around commit [915e28](https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/fizzbuzz-kata/tree/915e28c46d462c7b1e16d485bf1ca3e70606e04a)).

Then I've refeactored the solution so there are no return values (in branch [refactor/remove-all-return-values](https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/fizzbuzz-kata/tree/refactor/remove-all-return-values)), later merged to master

While removing all return values, I tried the generalise the solution, with an Action, Condition, Executor, who was discarded. That WIP is stored in [wip/generalised-version-with-executor-and-condition](https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/fizzbuzz-kata/tree/wip/generalised-version-with-executor-and-condition)
